# Python-Tetris

minimal tetris.py for under 180 lines of python code (if you delete all the comments and credits)
just with the built-in python libraries - batteries included, no external libraries needed.
it has been optimized to run also on very old platforms so more code is included than necessary like the print alias
this version runs in the pure console window (tested with Windows) you wonÂ´t get it to work with Sublime Text

The version without comments and credits is called tetris_minimal with 180 lines of code.

This version has been tested under Python 2.7 in a console window under Windows. It runs in a console window, 
not in SublimeText or so.

If you find any bugs please keep them or maybe improve the code and send it back to me.

The code may run or not according to your environment especially regarding you console and keyboard properties.

Or take the python code and compile it it into a Javascript code with the excellent transcrypt library you can find
at http://www.transcrypt.org
